- TODOs:
  - Implement a state of TurtleBotDockingStation saying that it is currently occupied by another TurtleBot once the central server is in place.
  - Maybe implement functionality to remotely prompt the TurtleBot to honk or play pre-recorded audio announcements (e.g., as advertisement).
  - Have some sort of feedback mechanism saying that an obstacle was detected, that the cliff sensor triggered, that the orientation lost etc. some time in the distant future.
